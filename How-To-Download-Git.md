1. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Select your operating system of choice

4. A download of a .exe file will start. Open it when it finishes downloading. You will be prompted to allow it to make changes on your device, select yes.
5. Once the .exe is open, feel free to read through the GNU General Public License. Click install after you read it.

6. Once Git is finished downloading, click finish. You can unselect the release notes option if you do not care to see them. If you keep it selected, a webpage will open with the release notes.
