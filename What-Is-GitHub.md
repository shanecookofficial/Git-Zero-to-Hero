# What is GitHub?

According to Wikipedia, GitHub "[is a platform and cloud-based service for software development and version control using Git, allowing developers to store and manage their code. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#:~:text=is%20a%20platform,for%20every%20project.)"

Code is managed in repositories. According to Wikipedia, "[a repository is a data structure that stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure.](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)#:~:text=a%20repository%20is%20a%20data%20structure%20that%20stores%20metadata%20for%20a%20set%20of%20files%20or%20directory%20structure.>)" Repositories can and are also refered to as 'codebases'. Think of a repository as a shared folder that contains all of the files for a project.

In the [What is a Version Control System lesson](What-Is-A-Version-Control-System.md), we explored the concept using the example of a team collaborating on a Tic-Tac-Toe project. To ensure efficient collaboration, a GitHub repository is created, granting each team member access. GitHub's user-friendly interface tracks and displays the project's change history, making it effortless to monitor the project's status and development. Furthermore, GitHub offers security features, including code review requirements, to enhance the project's integrity. This way, if any issues or bugs arise, it's straightforward to revert to a previous version, ensuring a smooth and secure development process.
